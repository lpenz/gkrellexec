h1. Introduction

**gkrellexec** is a plugin for gkrellm that displays the return status of arbitrary shell commands.

Up to 10 shell commands can be specified, each with a name, timeout and different times to sleep after a success or a failure.

gkellexec displays a panel in gkrellm, with one line per process, showing its last exit status (**T** for timeout, **O** for ok, **E** for error) and its name.

h1. Installation

To build it, just run _make_. gkrellm's header files must be installed.

To install, you can either run _make install_ so that it is copied to the default @/usr/lib/gkrellm2@; or you can copy gkrellexec.so to @$HOME/.gkrellm2/plugins@.

h1. Configuration

Enable it in gkrellm's plugin configuration.

On the plugins's configuration screen, there is a tab for each process with the configurable options. The process is disabled if it has no name. The shell command is run with _/bin/sh -c **command**_, so that shell syntax is fully available.
