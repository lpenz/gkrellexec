<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>
**gkrellexec** is a plugin for gkrellm that displays the return status of
arbitrary shell commands.
</P>
<P>
Up to 10 shell commands can be specified, each with a name, timeout and
different times to sleep after a success or a failure.
</P>
<P>
gkellexec displays a panel in gkrellm, with one line per process, showing its
last exit status (**T** for timeout, **O** for ok, **E** for error) and its
name.
</P>
<H1>Installation</H1>
<P>
To build it, just run <I>make</I>. gkrellm's header files must be installed.
</P>
<P>
To install, you can either run <I>make install</I> so that it is copied to
the default <CODE>/usr/lib/gkrellm2</CODE>; or you can copy gkrellexec.so to
<CODE>$HOME/.gkrellm2/plugins</CODE>.
</P>
<H1>Configuration</H1>
<P>
Enable it in gkrellm's plugin configuration.
</P>
<P>
On the plugins's configuration screen, there is a tab for each process with the
configurable options. The process is disabled if it has no name. The shell
command is run with <I>/bin/sh -c "**command**"</I>, so that shell syntax is fully
available.
</P>
<H1>TODO</H1>
<UL>
<LI>Improve configuration screen layout: align, enlarge command line text box.
<LI>Change status indicator from a char to a pixmap - use network pixmaps?
<LI>Allow configurable number of processes.
</UL>
